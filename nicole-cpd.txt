Reflection

In today's session I learnt that the web development industry is a rewarding, lucrative and creative industry to get into.

I also introduced myself to a class of strangers, this was initially a hard thing for me to do.

The part that I enjoyed the most meeting the group, learning about different roles and tools for a web developer

The part that I found hard was keeping up with viewing the presentation and looking at the web at the same time (toggling between the two)
